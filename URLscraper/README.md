# URLscraper
A set of scrapers to collect URLs from gesetze-im-internet.de (`URLscraper_G.py`), verwaltungsvorschriften-im-internet.de (`URLscraper_V.py`) and rechtsprechung-im-internet.de (`URLscraper_R.py`).

Run from command line without arguments. A .txt with the URL list is created in the same folder.
